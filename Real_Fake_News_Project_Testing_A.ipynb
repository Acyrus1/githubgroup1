      "Enter news text: We all require joy, hope and optimism. In these darker times, take heart that people care, that kindnesses, innovation and generosity are happening all over the world. —  After the crushing and brutal massacre in San Bernardino, the terror attack in France and the shooting at a Colorado Planned Parenthood, we are in need of heartening news more than ever. Our souls require it to rehabilitate. It’s a time in our history when life can seem so out-of-control, when people appear more bent on vengeance than kindness and when they deem themselves entitled to take lives. It all coincides with our slow awakening of realizing the chasm of corruption is everywhere.  It can leave you disheartened, emotionally drifting and in such an overwhelmed state you may stand frozen because you have no idea of where to begin, or if any action you take will matter.  Despite the mass infusion of tragedy playing on every media, instances of generosity, heroism, hope, happiness, joy and love abound. You can find them right here in this sunny compilation, but be sure to look for them in your own life, too. Be sure to keep your faith in people alive.  After a full immersion into soul-gladdening stories, the laughter, tears, smiles and elation have overcome any doubt within me that our world is nothing less than a miracle.  All the feels straight ahead.  A Nigerian boy solves a 30-year math equation, is recognized by a Japanese university. Monsanto will close three of its facilities. We are making a difference! A woman broken down on the highway meets an angel. #SaluteJose #StayKind Rosa Parks has been honored with a reserved front seat on Texas buses. This little boy giving his sister bone marrow, even though he believed it would kill him. A city letting people pay parking fines with canned goods for the hungry. The 18-year old grandson taking his grandma to prom, and other feel-goods. The janitor and cook who turned from workers to volunteers of a center after it closed, to take care of the elderly.\n",
